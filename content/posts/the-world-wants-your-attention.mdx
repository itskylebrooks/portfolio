### The saturation point

In the last few days, on my way to the university, I started to notice how many ads are around me: on windows, on train displays, on billboards at stations... It feels like the world is trying to get into my head from all directions. And this is only public transport, which in my opinion should be ad-free. A quiet ride shouldn’t be paid with attention.

### How we got here

The marketing department of every company wants the same thing: our attention. The method is simple—put ads everywhere and hope something sticks. At the same time, the ads themselves keep getting more ridiculous and lower in quality. I see two clear reasons.

First, how we consume changed. People scroll social media instead of reading books. Short videos replaced movies for many. Fewer people learn even the basics of art and design, so weak visuals pass as “good enough.”

Second, publishing is almost free. You can push ads into apps, websites, podcasts, streaming shows, and screens in shopping malls. Making them is cheap too—phone cameras, simple editing tools, and now LLMs for instant copy. When distribution is close to free, the logic shifts from “make one strong message” to “spray a thousand weak ones,” and craft slowly dies.

### Posters

This is why older posters—from the ’50s to the ’80s—still feel special to me. The drawings, the photos, the fonts, the composition, even the short lines of text had a purpose. Space was limited, so every choice mattered. You might see one poster and remember it for weeks. I look at these three brands and I can almost taste the Coke, touch the Macintosh, and wear the Levi’s. Today the strategy is different: when craft doesn’t make it stick, frequency will. More placements, more clickbait, more banners.

At the start of the Web 2.0 era, many services honestly tried to be clean and useful—Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, Twitter. They felt convenient and mostly distraction-free. Over time, growth and investor pressure changed the incentives. The decline even has a name now: enshittification. Wikipedia [explains it this way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification):

> Enshittification… is a pattern in which two-sided online products and services decline in quality over time. Initially, vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers (such as advertisers), and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize short-term profits for shareholders.

You can see it in subscription hierarchies where—even if you pay—you still see ads. This is no longer about “supporting the platform.” It’s about charging twice: once with your time, and again with your money.

### The fix (for now)

There is one practical way to make the internet calmer: use an ad blocker. Everyone should have the right to stop auto-playing videos and half-page banners. Time is limited; I won’t spend 30 seconds on an ad before every short clip when I just need one answer.

Some people say that watching ads helps platforms or creators survive. If support is the goal, direct payment is better. Even with optimistic ad rates, a creator earns only a few dollars per thousand views. A direct $10 donation equals thousands of ad views, arrives immediately, and most of it goes to the person you want to support, not to an ad stack and middlemen. It’s also honest—you choose to support, rather than being taxed by interruptions.

Sometimes I open a site without an ad blocker by accident. It’s shocking. Pop-ups on top of pop-ups, videos starting with sound, cookie banners pushing you to “accept all,” tiny content squeezed between moving boxes. Compare that mess to early Web 1.0 pages: mostly text, a few links, a clear structure you could read on any device. The promise of the internet was access to information for everyone. The irony is that now we also get access to ads everywhere, first.

### Where this ends

We’re entering a new era of chatbots and generated video. Ads will change with it—more personal, more blended into content, and harder to spot. Maybe ad blockers will be restricted in some places. More likely, they’ll simply become less useful when you can’t tell which part is the ad and which part is the content. If the border disappears, blocking becomes guesswork.

That’s why the best defense is not only technical but also personal and architectural. Choose products that don’t fight you for your attention. Set defaults that make the quiet option win by default: no autoplay, no feeds, offline by choice when you can. As long as I can choose, I won’t donate my time, money, or attention to this treadmill. I use [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/). It also cuts tracking and limits the free flow of my data, which is a bigger topic for another post.

### My line in the sand

Clarity and simplicity matter. My projects will never have ads. If I need to cover costs, I’ll use donations and optional subscriptions. That keeps the experience clean and honest. It’s not “anti-business.” It’s a choice to build software that respects people. The model should earn attention by being useful, not hijack it. That’s the whole point.

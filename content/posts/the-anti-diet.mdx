### Why I’m writing this  
  
There are a few reasons I’m writing this, and they all connect. First, I want to share my thoughts with other people — maybe inspire someone, maybe just pass on a small piece of knowledge that helped me. Sometimes I read things that quietly change how I see myself, and I hope my writing can do the same for someone else, even if just once.  
  
The second reason is personal. When I write my principles publicly, I make them real. A written promise is harder to ignore than a thought in my head. If I publish an idea, I want to live by it, not contradict it. I don’t want my blog to be a list of nice theories — I want it to be a mirror of what I actually practice.  
  
And finally, writing helps me think. Thoughts are vague until you give them shape. When I put them on the page, I can see patterns, contradictions, things I forgot. I’m a visual person, so I need to see ideas in front of me — to read them, return to them, refine them. Writing this kind of manifesto isn’t about perfection; it’s about clarity. It’s how I remind myself of what matters before life gets noisy again.  
  
### Coffee — a tool, not a routine  
  
Coffee is everywhere — the morning reflex, the study break, the “let’s catch up” default. It’s not the drink that gets me into trouble; it’s the frequency. A week of “every day” and the edges start to show: sleep slides, focus feels jumpy, and my body quietly asks for a bigger dose tomorrow. The machine shots are the worst offenders — clean in the moment, heavy on the nerves for hours.  
  
My body doesn’t negotiate about this. If I stack coffee on multiple days in a row, the signals arrive fast: heartburn, twitchy muscles, that brittle “wired but tired” feeling. Sometimes I sleep less and feel fine without it; sometimes I’ve slept well and still think coffee will help, and it doesn’t. I’ve never been truly addicted, mostly because my stomach vetoes the habit — cappuccino, latte, “real” espresso from a café — they’re all more likely to punch back than to help.  
  
So I changed the rule. Coffee lives in two lanes only: first, **real low battery on a real day** — exam morning, deep work with a clear finish line, or just a bad night’s sleep (but as an exception — otherwise, I need to fix my sleep schedule). Second, **a social moment I actually want to taste** — sitting with a friend, slow talk, a small cup I notice instead of inhaling. Early in the day, not every day, and never as a fix for boredom or mood. If I’m reaching for a third reason, I take that as a sign to drink water, walk five minutes, or close my eyes and reset instead.  
  
And yes, tea deserves a footnote here because it can play the same game. Black and green tea are gentler but they still poke the nervous system — and they can trigger the same heartburn for me if I’m careless. Chamomile is the opposite direction and honestly the best option when I want to calm down or head off a headache — but again, it’s a tool, not a daily routine. The point is the same across the board: stimulants when there’s a reason, not as wallpaper for the day.  
  
### Bread & buns — comfort, not a base

Bread is the easy button: toast at breakfast, a quick sandwich at lunch, a pastry “because it’s there,” a burger in the evening. For me the problem isn’t “bread is evil,” it’s quantity. Two slices become four, a roll becomes two, and by day’s end I’ve eaten half a loaf—plus the add-ons that hide in plain sight: potato buns, sesame burger buns, pita, wraps, lavash, bagels, börek, stuffed “meat buns,” pretzels, croissants. Different names, same pattern: fast carbs, little staying power.

It’s also a bad teammate for a calorie deficit. Bread alone doesn’t carry enough protein, fiber, or micronutrients to keep you full, so you stack extras—cheese, spreads, processed meats—and the calories spike fast while satiety lags. White bread is the worst version of this: soft, tasty, gone in twelve minutes, hunger back in forty-five.

So I changed the role it plays. Bread is a side, **not the base**. If I want it, I make it earn its place with portion first: one good slice instead of three; half a roll, not two; open-faced instead of double. Then I build around anchors—eggs, tuna, chicken, cottage cheese, beans—and put vegetables on the plate so it actually lands.

Quality matters, but quantity decides the day. I avoid white bread as my default and reach for whole-grain (Vollkorn) bread—dense rye or whole-grain sourdough—because the fiber slows things down and the taste asks me to eat less, slower. Still, even the good stuff adds up if I treat it like air. I try not to stack bread products across meals (toast + sandwich + burger bun = autopilot). If it’s a bakery morning, I let it be a treat and don’t pretend it’s lunch.

I’m not cutting bread out. I’m right-sizing it. When it’s chosen and measured, it’s comfort. When it quietly doubles and triples through the day, it’s noise.

### Carbonated drinks & juice — childhood habits, adult rules  
  
This one started at home. In summer, a cold bottle on the table was normal — birthdays, heat outside, fizz inside. I didn’t drink it every day, but when we bought it, I drank a lot. Juice lived in the same cupboard space: apple, orange, and my favorite “multivitamin” mix — sweet with a little sour, that warm orange color I can still picture. It felt harmless. It felt like childhood.  
  
Then my body started voting against it. As carbonated drinks got easier to buy everywhere, my stomach began complaining — bloating, that tight feeling, and the sugar rush that turns into a drop forty minutes later. Same with juice: a big glass gave me five bright minutes and then a slow, hungry fog. It also made me want more — more drink, more snacks — because sweet teaches sweet.  
  
The “zero sugar” versions didn’t solve the real problem. They cut calories, yes, but they **keep the habit** — the constant sweet taste and the reflex to reach for a bottle when I’m bored or tired. They also keep the carbonation, which is fine sometimes but not great as a baseline; if I fill a day with bubbles, my stomach tells me I overdid it. Teeth don’t love the acid either. You don’t need a lecture to know that; a simple sip of water after is already better than nothing.  
  
Juice deserves honesty too. It isn’t evil, but it isn’t magic. It does have vitamins — it also strips out most fiber and concentrates sugar. Marketing sells the first half of that sentence. My rule now is simple: if I want fruit, I try to eat the fruit. If I really want a drink, I’ll make a small smoothie at home (actual fruit, cold milk, maybe oats) or pick a shop option that’s truly no-added-sugar — and I treat it like a snack, not a hydration plan.  
  
So the boundary looks like this: I’m fine with a cold Coke at a party or a small glass of juice at a festive table. That’s context; that’s memory. What I don’t do anymore is keep bottles in the house “just because.” Day to day it’s water first, sparkling water with lemon when I want the bite, milk-based drinks like kefir when I want something that feeds the gut instead of feeding a craving. Frequency is the whole story here — once in a while is a pleasure, every day is a loop. And in these cases, consistency is what kills.  
  
### Fast food — special, not a system

Where I grew up there wasn’t a single McDonald’s, KFC, or Subway in town. The nearest one was a trip away, so it felt like a small holiday: family, mall, Happy Meal, done. That scarcity kept it in the right box — a treat, not a default. It was fun, and sometimes my stomach disagreed later, but the rule was clear: sometimes.

Years later a KFC opened locally. It still didn’t replace normal food for me. A couple of times a month, max. That frequency matters, because fast food is engineered to be easy and loud at the same time — salt, fat, sweet, crunch — a flavor show that makes “enough” arrive late. It’s also brutally calorie-dense, so it’s effortless to overshoot without noticing. Convenient? Yes. Neutral? No.

Cost plays mind games too. In Germany, fast food isn’t exactly cheap, which quietly slows me and other people down. In other places (hello, United States) it can be cheaper than a decent meal, which is a policy problem but also a personal trap: the faster and cheaper it gets, the easier it is to make it your baseline. And once it becomes baseline, energy and focus **pay the tax**.

Another piece: the supply chain. To hit speed and consistency, a lot of ingredients are pre-processed, frozen, flavored, stabilized. That doesn’t make them poison; it just means they’re built for logistics, not for how I want to feel after lunch. I also don’t fully trust the “meat story” behind a rushed burger. If I want real protein, I’d rather cook once and eat twice than outsource it to a heat lamp.

So my rule set is simple. Fast food is allowed, but it lives in the “special” lane — travel days, late trains, friends after a long session. Not a system I lean on. When I do go, I keep it small, drink water, skip the extra sauce and second side, and I stop when the taste stops being interesting. Then I go back to meals that leave me steady instead of sleepy.

### Sweets — the small loop that grows  
  
This one is loaded with memories. At home it was normal to have something sweet around: birthday cakes, summer ice cream, Kinder eggs, and the classics — Mars, Twix, Bounty, KitKat. I can almost taste the wrappers when I think about it. None of that felt dangerous; it was just part of how we celebrated and how we treated ourselves. The trouble started later, when “a treat” slid into “a little something after lunch,” then “with breakfast,” then “with coffee because it’s cozy.” Coffee + a Franzbrötchen is a perfect combo — and a perfect way to train my brain to expect sugar every time I want comfort.  
  
The pattern is simple. A sweet hit gives five bright minutes and then a quiet drop. Most days it doesn’t feed me; it just adds empty calories and makes me want a second piece. That’s the part I try to catch now. When my hand goes for a bar, I ask one plain question: do I actually need this, or is this anxiety/boredom/tiredness asking for a quick fix? Nine times out of ten it’s the second. And the more often I do it, the duller the taste becomes. You stop noticing the thing you’re eating every day.  
  
So I changed the rules and made them visible. In [Ritus, my habit tracker,](https://ritus.itskylebrooks.tech/) I keep a simple target: at least three **sweet-free** days each week. By “sweets” I mean sugar-heavy foods and drinks — candy, pastries, sweetened yogurts, soft drinks, the whole family. When I ran a week without them, something obvious happened: the next dessert tasted amazing again. Portion felt enough. I actually noticed the flavors instead of inhaling them. That’s what I want — not constant sugar, but real enjoyment when I choose it.  
  
I’m not banning anything. Calling food “evil” just makes the craving louder. I’m treating sweets like fireworks: rare, deliberate, and watched on purpose. If I’m hungry, I eat like an adult first — protein, real food — and then decide if I still want dessert. If I do, I sit down and eat just that, without a screen, without doing three other things. And when I feel the pull for the wrong reason — stress, bad sleep, a flat day — I try a different lever: water, a short walk, two pages of a book, a quick message to a friend. Most cravings are mood requests in sugar’s clothing.  
  
The goal isn’t to live a joyless life. It’s to keep joy from turning into a loop. Make sweets special again — and the rest of the time, let food do its actual job.  

### Ultra-processed food — convenience with a cost

There’s a world where dinner lives in the freezer and cooks in five minutes. I’m not against it in emergencies — late train, empty fridge, exam week. Some of those meals are fine. But the rule I’ve learned is simple: the more a food is built for storage and speed, the more it needs help to taste good and last — stabilizers, emulsifiers, flavor boosters, sugar, lots of salt, cheap fats. That help has a cost. You feel full for a moment, then weirdly hungry again; energy bumps and dips instead of staying steady.

“Frozen” isn’t the enemy. Plain frozen vegetables, berries, fish — great. The problem is the ultra-processed, pre-assembled stuff: sauces thickened three ways, “smoke” without smoke, ingredient lists that read like a paragraph. Real food doesn’t survive months in a box without tricks. It also won’t carry the same fiber or freshness as a simple meal you cook yourself. That doesn’t make it poison; it just means it’s built for logistics, not for how you want to feel tomorrow morning.

My guardrails are boring on purpose. If I can’t picture the ingredients as things in a normal kitchen, I don’t make it a habit. If I do buy a ready meal, I choose the shortest label, add something alive on the side — a salad, a handful of frozen veg, an egg — and I treat it like a one-off, not a system. Cook once on Sunday when you can and let leftovers do the fast-food job. Convenience is fine; living on it isn’t.

### Snacks — breaking the screen–snack pairing  
  
This one is basically sweets with better marketing. For me the problem isn’t “chips are evil,” it’s the pairing: screen + bag. I tell myself I’m multitasking, but I’m not — I’m just switching fast. Attention goes to the show, the hand keeps moving, and twenty minutes later the bag is a rumor. I’ve done this at my desk, on the couch, on the train. The result is always the same: I don’t remember the plot well, and I don’t remember the food either — just the heaviness after.  
  
Snacks are designed for autopilot. Salt + fat + crunch are tuned so “enough” arrives late. Some mixes even stack flavors so your tongue keeps asking “what’s next?” It’s a tiny addiction loop: loud taste up front, no real satiety, reach again. Add a screen and you remove the last bit of feedback that would normally slow you down — the simple act of noticing. That’s how a “handful” becomes half a bag.  
  
So I’m unpairing the habit. If I want to watch something, I watch it. If I want a snack, I make it a tiny meal and give it a plate, a seat, and five quiet minutes. The moment I treat it like food, the spell breaks. Portion matters — not because I’m afraid of snacks, but because quantity is the whole story here. When I plan the amount, I actually taste it. When I don’t, I graze and forget.  
  
I also try to keep the “what is this?” test in my head. If I can describe it in five plain words, it’s usually fine. “Potatoes, oil, salt” — okay. “Neon dust mystery flakes” — that’s entertainment, not nourishment. And because macros matter over feelings, I look for something with at least a little protein or fiber so it lands: yogurt with fruit, nuts with an apple, popcorn I pop myself, roasted chickpeas. If I truly want chips, I buy a small bag, pour it in a bowl, sit down, and finish it — no laptop, no phone. Then I’m done.  
  
None of this is about being strict. It’s about not letting a background habit steal attention and calories without asking. Snacks are fine when I choose them. They’re a bad deal when the show chooses for me.  
  
### Processed meats — convenience with a bill  
  
Sliced meat, sausages, bacon — they look like real food, they smell amazing, they sit in the “protein” part of the brain. That’s the trick. Most of the time you’re not buying meat; you’re buying a blend: water, salt, sugar, starch, oils, “smoke flavor,” preservatives — plus some meat. It tastes great because it’s engineered to. It also slides into the wrong slot in the day: what should be an occasional snack becomes breakfast, then lunch, then “quick dinner on bread.”  
  
I’ve done that slide. It feels efficient in the moment and then I’m hungry again an hour later. The salt makes me feel heavy, the calories add up fast, and the “protein” I thought I ate wasn’t the kind my body actually wanted. This is the exciting lie of processed food: it looks wholesome, it behaves like entertainment.  
  
I’m not pretending it isn’t delicious. I’m saying it’s not a good default. If I want **actual** protein with a clean story, the list is boring on purpose: eggs, chicken thighs, plain fish (fresh or canned), beans and lentils, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt. Cook once, eat twice. A tray of roasted chicken on Sunday beats four emergency salami sandwiches on Wednesday.  
  
Here’s how I keep myself honest, without turning it into a spreadsheet. If the ingredient list reads like a paragraph, it isn’t “just meat” and it doesn’t belong in my daily plan. On tired nights I reach for real food first — scramble a few eggs, open a can of tuna, reheat chicken I cooked on Sunday — before I even think about opening a pack of sausages. And when I still want the processed stuff, I let it be what it is: a treat. Small portion, on purpose, enjoyed once, not a stand-in for dinner three days in a row.  
  
Taste now is fine. Taste as a lifestyle is not. The more I choose simple protein with a short label, the better I feel and the easier the next choice becomes. “Real” can be boring in a good way; it gives the energy back.  
  
### Alcohol — clarity beats ceremony  
  
I’ve never been drunk, and I don’t plan to be. Not because I’m special — because I like having my hands on the wheel. The trade is simple: alcohol steals sleep, blunts attention the next day, and pretends to be a social skill. I’d rather keep my head, especially when my work, training, and prayer all run better on a quiet nervous system.  
  
There’s also a line I drew in 2024. I made a small promise around one specific person: either we’d meet and share a drink once, or I’d stay at zero. We never met. The promise stayed. It’s not about nostalgia; it’s about keeping my word and keeping my mind. Since then, “I don’t drink” is a **complete sentence** — no footnotes, no debate.  
  
People say alcohol helps connection. I don’t buy it. If conversation needs ethanol to survive, it’s the wrong conversation or the wrong room. Real connection is attention, not blood alcohol. I’d rather toast with something that won’t bill me at 3 a.m., leave on time, and remember the evening clearly.  
  
I know the culture dresses drinking up — films, ads, the easy joke. That shine fades fast when you’re counting lost mornings. For me the math is clean: taste can be nice, but clarity is better. So I keep it at zero — not out of fear, but out of preference. A sober mind is the baseline I want to live from.  
  
### Smoking & vaping — lungs are for oxygen  
  
I never smoked and I never vaped. Partly because I grew up hating the smell — the stale cloud that creeps in through a window, the way it clings to clothes and hangs in the room after the person has left. Partly because the picture in my head has always been simple: smoke goes in, lungs pay the price. One of my favorite singers, who smoked, died of lung cancer when I was younger; that story stuck. My dad smoked for a while, but he hid it from us — never a cigarette in front of the kids. I respect that. It also told me he knew it wasn’t something to model.  
  
I saw the performance hit up close. I played basketball as a teen. Two-three years later I ran into a guy from those courts; we played one-on-one, and after a few minutes he was done — out of breath, asking for a break. He told me he’d started smoking and asked me not to tell his mom, who taught basketball. It was a ridiculous and sad little scene at the same time: talent arguing with a habit.  
  
Vaping tries to dodge that image. New packaging, candy flavors, softer smell, modern shapes — and the sales pitch that it’s “better than smoking.” Maybe it’s cleaner for bystanders; it’s still a nicotine machine dressed up as a gadget. It builds a loop fast, especially for teenagers: tap, inhale, repeat. Starting is easier than lighting a cigarette; stopping isn’t. I don’t need a second lever on my nervous system, and I don’t want my attention tied to a pocket ritual every hour.  
  
The “social” argument doesn’t convince me either. If the price of standing with a group is smoke in my lungs, I’ll find a different group. If I need a break, I can take a walk. If I need calm, I can breathe on purpose for sixty seconds. None of that leaves a bill in my chest or my wallet. Speaking of money: add a year of pods or packs and ask what you traded away — a short trip, a course, a new bike, part of a desktop setup. Habits are budgets with marketing.  
  
I think the culture is slowly letting go of the idea that smoking looks cool. It doesn’t. It looks like boredom with a flavor. If there’s a hole it’s trying to fill — stress, loneliness, awkwardness — that’s **the real problem to work on**: train, write, pray, build something with your hands, talk to a person who actually listens. Lungs are for oxygen. I’m keeping it that way.  
  
### Drugs — hard pass  
  
I grew up in Russia, and school made the message blunt: drugs end lives. We watched stories of families collapsing, of people trading everything for another dose. Maybe that early education is why just thinking about it still feels terrifying. I’ve never tried anything and I don’t want to. Zero curiosity. Zero romance.  
  
After moving to Germany I noticed a different attitude — more casual, more “it’s just an experience.” To me that reads like a purpose problem. When basic needs are covered but direction is fuzzy, the hunt for “something interesting” gets louder. Drugs offer a shortcut: a cheap peak when the day feels flat. The price shows up later — tolerance, fog, and a mind you trust a little less each week.  
  
I’m not a doctor, and this isn’t medical advice. I know some substances exist in clinical context. That’s **not** my world. In my world, the rule is simple: no experiments. The brain learns fast from big dopamine spikes; once it tastes the high, it wants a second lesson. If life is already shaky — lonely, bored, stressed — that shortcut doesn’t fix the cause, it widens the crack.  
  
So I keep the door closed and put the energy somewhere that compounds: training, writing, building small things, real conversations, faith. When the urge to escape shows up, I treat it as a signal to make something or to move my body, not a reason to numb out. I want a life that doesn’t need an exit hatch.  
  
### Why this matters  
  
Habits aren’t background—they’re identity in slow motion. Every small choice teaches the body and mind what “normal” is, and then that normal becomes you. I once saw a short clip of an old teacher talking to his students: imagine you could own only one car for your whole life — no upgrades, no trade-ins. You’d baby it, keep it clean, fix issues early, choose fuel carefully. Same rule for the body. **You get one.** Treat it like a disposable rental and it starts to feel that way. Treat it like something you’ll need in ten years, and ten years begins to look different.  
  
Food is not just fuel; it’s direction. What you eat today won’t rewrite your life tomorrow, but it will write the next page. Energy, sleep, skin, mood, attention, training, exams—everything sits on top of your baseline. If “normal” is daily alcohol, late-night overeating, constant sugar, you’ll drift toward a version of yourself that is tired and hard to steer. If “normal” is boring, steady food and fewer chemical levers, you’ll drift toward someone who can actually do the work and enjoy the day. It isn’t moral; it’s compounding.  
  
I’m not pretending I got this right from the start. A lot of my defaults came from family patterns and the culture around me. I had to unlearn them and write new rules that fit my life now. I already have a sensitive stomach; that’s reality, not a verdict. The best time to course-correct is always now. Not by promising perfection, but by choosing one better default and letting it repeat until it becomes who I am.

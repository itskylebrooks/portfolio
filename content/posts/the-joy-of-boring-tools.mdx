### The clean-slate itch

New apps promise a new self. Install, create a few “objects,” wire a couple of backlinks, and suddenly the room feels tidy. It’s dopamine dressed as discipline. The setup mimics progress so well that it’s easy to mistake arranging for creating.  

I’ve done this loop enough times to recognize the pattern: euphoria, architecture, fatigue, drift. The tool becomes a mood board for a life I’m not actually living yet.

### When the system becomes the hobby

Complex note apps reward system-building. Databases, tags, relations, templates, automations—it’s Lego for the knowledge worker.  

The problem isn’t capability; it’s gravity. Every new structure wants maintenance. Every clever schema wants grooming. Before long, I’m tending a garden of concepts instead of harvesting ideas. The map gets prettier while the territory is neglected. The cost isn’t money; it’s momentum.

I used to spend days and hours building elaborate systems for my digital library — moving books between folders, tagging, color-coding, cross-referencing metadata. Now I keep a single note with a simple table: Book Title, Author, Publication Year, and Date Finished. Nothing more. All the other information already lives on the internet; why bother duplicating it? Exactly as much as I need.

### The tool that disappears

Apple Notes doesn’t audition for the role of “second brain.” It opens fast, syncs quietly, and gets out of the way. No mythology, no dashboards, no false promises of total recall.  

I don’t think about the app; I think in it. That’s the point. Good tools don’t perform; they vanish. When the friction drops to zero, the note becomes a muscle memory: capture, return to life, continue. Beauty here is not in features but in the absence of decisions.

### A small manifesto

I don’t quit fancy note apps because they’re bad (well, some of them actually are). I quit them because they are too interesting. Interesting tools tempt me to polish the workshop instead of using the hammer.  

Apple Notes is boring in the most productive way. It gives me the same gift a blank page gives a writer and a clear mat gives a martial artist: no excuses, just practice.  

If I ever test another system, it will be for one narrow purpose and one short week. If it helps me think, it stays in a corner. If it helps me organize my organizing, it goes.

The older I get, the more I value tools that make no claim on my attention. The work is hard enough. Let the software be quiet.

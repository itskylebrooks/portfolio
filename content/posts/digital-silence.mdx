### On the train

[In my last article](https://itskylebrooks.vercel.app/blog/the-world-wants-your-attention) I started with what I see on the way to the university, and I'll do it again. Hamburg is big and mixed—different ages, languages, styles—so public transport is a moving cross-section of how people live. In the last months I've tried to be present there on purpose: phone in the pocket, eyes open. What I notice is the contrast. While I look around, most people look down. Phones in hands, headphones on heads. I kept thinking: fifty years ago, what would someone think seeing this—rows of people hypnotized by small flickering rectangles? And another thought I don't like: is this how I look from the side when I'm on my phone? Nobody knows what I'm doing in there—work or games or news—so from the outside it all looks the same.

### What we actually do on screens

I can't speak for everyone, but the patterns look simple: chatting or scrolling. Chatting I don't mind (better than loud calls in a packed bus). But it's not most of what I see. Mostly it's scrolling—TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts. Clips, endless clips. One evening on a bus a teenager in front of me was on TikTok: leaned forward, phone on his knee, mouth slightly open, eyes flat, thumb moving every few seconds. It felt dystopian. Sometimes it isn't short video; it's still a feed—endless cards of "news" with every fifth one an ad, the timeline on X/Twitter, a shopping app with "you might also like." The feed is now the default UI because it buys and sells our time. Games show up too, though less often, but the mechanism is the same: variable rewards in a loop.

Headphones tell a related story. Again, not for everyone, but the default seems to be music, not podcasts or audiobooks. That's what I do, too. Music is easier. It fills the space without asking anything back.

### Why we reach for noise

There's a quote that fits here: nobody is really thinking about you; everyone is thinking about themselves. We worry about how we look on the train, but everybody else is inside their own little world. That's not the main point today, though. The point is distraction. We choose it. No one forces us to install social apps or music platforms. So why do we keep opening them?

Because boredom is uncomfortable. The brain doesn't like empty space, especially when there are a thousand easy ways to fill it. Two taps and you get novelty, sound, color, a tiny hit of "something is happening." It feels harmless. But it trains a habit: whenever the world goes quiet—on the bus, in a line, in a room—you reach for input.

### Humans, biology, and the cheap buffet

Here's the harder part to admit. Humans are lazy by default. Not morally lazy—biologically efficient. Our bodies prefer the shortest path to comfort and calories and certainty. That's why we don't have millions of people who are at the same time deeply educated, rich, healthy, and fit: every one of those qualities asks you to push against biology in small ways every day. Don't eat everything that tastes good. Don't scroll every time you're restless. Don't watch another episode when you said you'd sleep. It's all the same muscle.

And the modern world makes pushing back harder. Cheap, tasty food is everywhere. Social media and games are "free." Wi-Fi is on every corner. Delivery arrives tomorrow. Consumer choice is better than ever, but so is consumer temptation. The buffet is always open.

### Dopamine, in plain words

Dopamine is not "pleasure." It's the brain's motivation signal. When you expect a reward and move toward it, dopamine rises; when you get more than you expected, it spikes; when you get less, it drops. That rise and drop teach your brain what to repeat. In a healthy loop, you set a goal, do something hard, get a result, and your brain says, "Nice—do that again."

Feeds, snacks, and constant noise hijack that loop. They give you tiny rewards with almost no effort, again and again. Baseline goes up, sensitivity goes down, and normal life starts to feel flat by comparison. A quiet bus ride, a blank page, a slow walk—these feel "boring" only because your reward system has been tuned by faster hits. The system isn't broken; it's just being pulled by constant external noise.

### Where this is going (and why boredom matters)

Boredom isn't a bug; it's a signal. It's your mind telling you there's free bandwidth. If you can stand in that space for a few minutes—no feed, no song—ideas begin to show up. Not always dramatic ideas, but real ones: a line for a blog post, a tiny improvement to your project, a message you should send, a thought about your life you've been avoiding. This is why I'm writing about "digital silence." It's not ascetic theater. It's a way to give attention back to the things that grow when you stop feeding the machine.

### Practicing digital silence

Let me stay with boredom for a moment. The noises we invite—feeds, clips, constant music—are easy rewards that cost almost no effort, and that's exactly why the brain keeps asking for them. There's a price, though. When quick hits are always available, the brain spends less energy on the slow work: thinking, connecting ideas, imagining, praying, planning. Those muscles don't disappear, but they do get quiet under the stream. The good news is they wake up fast once the stream slows. Unlike lungs or liver, the mind is plastic; it can be trained back toward depth with small daily choices.

The first step is simple and a little uncomfortable: start noticing. Notice what you open and when. Notice why—bored, tired, avoiding a task, lonely. Not to judge yourself, but to turn off autopilot. Presence is a skill. It begins with naming what you're doing in the moment you're doing it.

### Cutting the noise (screens and sound)

When the noticing is honest, the next move is subtraction. Reduce the places that sell you quick novelty. If social media is the trigger, remove it; if you can't remove it yet, hide it, sign out, block the sites, make the easy path harder. It's not about being radical on day one; it's about breaking the loop so your attention can breathe. You won't miss anything important—people who need you can still reach you directly—but you will miss a thousand small interruptions you never chose.

The same applies to audio. Music is wonderful, but as a constant background it becomes another feed. Lyrics are input; they take space your thoughts could use. For focused work, quiet or neutral sound makes the day shorter because you aren't cashing in the reward before you've earned it. And in so-called "empty" moments—on the bus, in a line, on a walk—silence is the point. Take the headphones off now and then. Let the world sound like itself. At first your brain will demand a song or a scroll; wait a minute longer than you want. The itch fades, and something else arrives.

### FOMO is a trick

Fear of missing out is a neat story the feed tells to keep you close: that there is a conversation happening somewhere, that you'll be left behind if you don't watch the stream. In practice, the cost is larger than the gain. You trade hours for crumbs—most of which you forget by evening. Real connection doesn't require you to monitor everything; it asks you to show up for a few people with your whole attention. Real news finds you anyway, through friends, newsletters you chose, or the next day when the facts are clearer. The world moves fast, but your life doesn't need to.

### What boredom builds

Here is the payoff. When the inputs quiet down, boredom fills the room for a while. Stay with it. On day one it feels empty. On day three it starts to feel open. Your mind begins to propose small, concrete actions: write three sentences; refactor that function; fix the copy on the landing page; text your friend and set a time; read two pages of the book you keep avoiding. These are tiny, but they compound. They are also yours. They aren't pushed into your head by an algorithm; they rise from the life you're actually living.

I've noticed a pattern. Ideas show up when I'm walking without headphones, washing dishes, waiting for a train, sitting on the mat before practice. They are quiet at first, so they're easy to miss if the default is noise. Give them a place to land: a small note on your phone, a pocket notebook, a voice memo. Make → ship → explain becomes possible not because you forced creativity, but because you stopped drowning the signal. The work feels more like steady breath than a sprint, and the day ends with the kind of tired that lets you sleep.

### Digital silence

Digital silence isn't about proving purity. It's about choosing an environment where attention can recover and then do what it was built to do: notice, connect, make. Boredom is the doorway. Walk through it, and you'll find that the world didn't shrink when the noise faded—the room for real work got larger.

## From notes to projects

I keep a messy pile of notes—half-thoughts, fragments, bad drawings of good ideas. The goal isn’t to curate a museum; it’s to turn sparks into heat. Notes are seeds; projects are plants. The garden grows by planting often.

Start tiny. Write a one-line note that names a pain or a pull. Extract a single task that creates a visible change. Timebox it to one sitting—an evening, a train ride, or a Sunday morning. A micro-project has one input, one output, and a clear “done.”

```
note -> task -> tiny build -> share
```

That loop is the engine. Momentum compounds because finished things teach. Small finished beats big unfinished every time.

A good micro-project fits on a sticky note, does one job for one person (often me), leaves behind a tangible artifact—a link, a file, a chart—and can be shared without a tour guide. My quick definition of done: a working link, a 30‑second demo, and a one‑paragraph README.

Some notes convert especially well:

* A pain note ("updating progress on mobile is annoying") → a one-tap widget.
* A repetition note ("I keep typing the same JSON") → a generator script.
* A friction note ("sharing a screenshot takes three steps") → a single “Copy as image” action.

Stale notes get archived; fresh ones get a date and a task.

Sharing is part of the build, not a separate ceremony. Ship within 24 hours if you can—a gist, a screenshot with a link, a tiny CLI, a single-page utility. If someone else can use it without your narration, it’s ready.

The compounding is quiet: reusable pieces accumulate, taste sharpens, and confidence turns into muscle memory. Each small win lowers the cost of the next one.

Common traps:

* Epic drift — cut back to one visible win.
* Process cosplay — no kanban for a three-hour build.
* Pixel heroics — function first.

After shipping, do a five-minute retro: what felt heavy, what nobody missed, what to try next. Iterate or freeze it—some tools want to stay small, and that’s honest.

Big vision doesn’t need big units of work. It needs frequent contact with reality. Start tiny, run the loop, share early. Keep the engine warm and the projects will stack into something larger than you planned.

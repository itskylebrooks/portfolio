### The promise and the price

Feeds sell three things: connection, knowledge, opportunity. The price arrives later — thin attention, noisy evenings, and that hollow feeling after “just one more.” What changed isn’t only volume; it’s intent. Niche platforms turned into machines tuned to extract time and data, then use that data to pull us back again. The loop optimizes itself.

Under the glossy surface, each platform carries a built-in message that shapes how we see ourselves — image apps nudge “worth = looks and highlights,” streak apps nudge “relationship = frequency,” short-post apps nudge “speed > depth.” Compare that with older mediums: a book quietly says the world is complex and needs time; a letter says communication doesn’t have to be frequent to be real. If you want the larger frame behind this idea, see Dino Ambrosi’s TEDx talk, [The Battle for Your Time: Exposing the Costs of Social Media](https://www.ted.com/talks/dino_ambrosi_the_battle_for_your_time_exposing_the_hidden_costs_of_social_media).

### The loop I fell into

My story was simple. Delete, reinstall, promise, repeat. I called it “research” or “networking,” but most days it was boredom or sadness and a wish for company without the risk of reaching a real person. Meanwhile the environment kept degrading — more ads, heavier algorithmic steering, low-effort content rising because it’s cheap to produce and easy to consume, now supercharged by generative tools that flood the stream. The breaking point was YouTube’s ad-block war turning every video into friction and the moment I saw I was outsourcing purpose to platforms. I wasn’t taking a break. I was done. Delete, not detox. If a tool fights me for control of my attention, it doesn’t live on my phone. If I need one tutorial, I find it, watch it, and leave — like an adult who knows why he came.

### Why I kept coming back

It wasn’t one reason; it was a net.

FOMO whispered that something important was happening somewhere and I’d miss it if I left. Convenience promised that “checking” takes only seconds — which quietly adds up to hours. Vanity metrics gave tiny hits that felt like connection but weren’t. The builder myth said I “needed” social to promote projects, even though the work that actually compounds is boring: a clear portfolio, honest docs, a small mailing list, steady commits, showing up where builders gather. And comfort — the hardest one — told me scrolling is safer than texting a friend when I’m lonely. All of that kept me in orbit until I named them and cut the fuel.

### What changed

Quieter days. Less anxiety. More actual work. When the inputs slowed, the urge to perform for a timeline faded and my attention started behaving like attention again — long enough to read ten pages, write three honest paragraphs, refactor one rough function, walk without headphones and let ideas catch up. I didn’t leave to be pure. I left to make space. The software is quiet; the hours now belong to things that survive the night — craft, faith, and conversations that go somewhere.

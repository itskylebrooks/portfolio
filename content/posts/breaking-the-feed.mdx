### The promise and the bill

Feeds sell me three things: connection, knowledge, opportunity. The bill shows up later. Evenings dissolve into “just one more,” attention splits into thin threads, and the room feels noisy even when it’s quiet.

YouTube pushed me there first. The ad-block cat-and-mouse turned every video into friction: warnings, reloads, 5–15 seconds of nothing, sometimes the player refusing to start until I surrendered. Instagram buried actual friends under Reels I didn’t ask for. X felt like a crowd shouting over itself. Pinterest became a museum of images I saved and never used. I tried alternatives—Bluesky, Tumblr, whatever new thing was trending—and the shape was always the same: an infinite list asking me to scroll.

I kept reinstalling: delete, promise, return. Sometimes I called it “research.” Sometimes I told myself I needed it for “networking.” Often I was just bored or sad and wanted company without the risk of reaching for a real person. The pattern was simple: novelty → scroll → a small hit → nothing kept. I closed the apps and I was still alone with myself, only later.

### The moment I opted out

Two things snapped it: YouTube breaking on purpose because of Adblock, and the realization that I was outsourcing purpose to platforms. I wasn’t “taking a break.” I was done.

Delete, not detox. Detox implies a return, a future where I manage the lever better. I don’t want a lever. If a tool fights me for control of my attention, it doesn’t live on my phone. No “just in case” accounts. If I need one tutorial or one talk, I can go find exactly that, watch it, and leave—like a normal adult. I don’t need to live inside the store to buy one thing.

I also accepted something obvious: Instagram wasn’t connecting me to friends. It was training me to perform in front of a system that hides the people I know behind ads and suggested posts. Forty “connections,” almost no conversation. Even when I posted something, half the audience didn’t see it, and many others scrolled past. That’s not a community; it’s a slot machine with better typography.

And yes—privacy. “Everyone collects data” was my lazy excuse. The truth is I don’t want to donate my messages, photos, and behavior to models I never agreed to train. If the price of “staying in touch” is permanent surveillance and a personality optimized for metrics, I’d rather pay with a little friction and keep the rest of me intact.

### A different stack for attention

I’m replacing feeds with a builder’s loop: make → ship → explain.

* Projects first. Portfolio, Flowday, Ritus, Enso, Lectum, Haven. Fewer dependencies, honest UI, something real in people’s hands. If I want novelty, I open code or Notes, not a timeline.
* Writing. Short posts like this—what I tried, what failed, what I learned. Writing forces clarity.
* Reading and faith. Scripture, essays, technical docs—chosen inputs, not pushed ones. Ten pages beat a hundred clips.
* Actual people. DMs, calls, coffee (although I don’t drink coffee anymore, but that’s another story). Audience metrics are not friendship. A real reply from one person is worth more than a hundred passive views.

This is not purity theatre. I’m not trying to be the hero of focus. I’m just pruning noise so I can hear my own signal again.

### The myths I believed (and the rules I live by now)

#### “YouTube makes me smarter.”

Sometimes, yes. But the time-to-signal ratio collapsed. When I need instruction, I search for one specific video, watch it, and leave. If a channel consistently respects my time, I save it to a short, intentional list. No feed.

#### “I need social media to promote my projects.”

Mostly a myth. What actually compounds: a clear portfolio, useful docs, real mailing lists, a steady GitHub trail, and showing up where builders gather. Slow, boring reputation beats viral roulette.

#### “All my friends are there.”

They aren’t. They’re in my messages, my calls, my city. If someone only exists for me as a story in a feed, we’re not in contact—we’re in parallel.

#### “I need inspiration.”

That was input addiction with a nice name. I don’t need more references; I need more attempts. Inspiration comes *after* I start, not before.

### The operating manual (for me, not a sermon)

* No feeds. No “parking” accounts. If I need one thing, I get one thing and leave.
* Create before consume. If I want novelty, I open Notes or code.
* Intentional inputs. Books, saved lectures, PDFs—things I chose on purpose.
* Replace the urge with action. Walk. Water. One message. Two pages.
* Review the trade. Each month: Did this make me kinder, sharper, calmer? If not, prune again.

### What I miss, what I don’t

I miss the fake feeling of being “caught up.” I miss the convenience of an endless stream, even though the endless part was the problem. I don’t miss being measured by a machine all day. I don’t miss optimizing my personality for recommendations. I don’t miss the hangover of an evening I can’t remember.

I didn’t leave platforms to make a point. I left to make space. Let the hours belong to things that survive the night—craft, faith, and conversations that go somewhere. If the world wants me, it can find me where I’m actually alive: building.

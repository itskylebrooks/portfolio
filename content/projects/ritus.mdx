### Why I Built It

I created Ritus because I wanted a habit tracker that actually fits into my daily life without adding friction. Many apps felt too complicated or cluttered, making it hard to stay consistent. With Ritus, I aimed to build a tool that’s simple, elegant, and focused solely on helping you build lasting habits—no distractions, just progress.

### Why I Built It

Ritus began as a simple side experiment—an attempt to streamline habit tracking into something truly effortless. Over time, it evolved into a philosophy-driven app that respects the natural flow of life and the importance of mindful progress. My goal has been to create a space where habits are not just tasks, but meaningful rituals that support well-being and personal growth. This project reflects a commitment to simplicity, intention, and the quiet power of daily practice.

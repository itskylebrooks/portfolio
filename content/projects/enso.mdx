### Enso — a calm place to learn (and keep) Aikidō

I’ve always loved how Aikidō is taught: quietly, patiently, one detail at a time. Most websites don’t feel like that. They’re either stacks of YouTube links or dense PDFs that are impossible to search on your phone while you’re tying your belt.

Enso is my answer: a minimal, fast knowledge base for techniques, exam programs, and terminology — with a contributor flow that lets teachers and students add what they know without wrestling a CMS.

It started small (eight techniques!) and then I fell down the rabbit hole of making the foundation feel right: the card rhythm, the search, the taxonomy, the bilingual copy, and a way for other people to help without breaking anything.

### What Enso Is (in one exhale)

- A search‑first library of techniques with short, clear summaries and badges (entry, hanmi, belt level).
- A Guide for the DAB exam path (5th Kyū → 1st Dan), plus a Dan Overview and an Advanced page for things like Saya no Uchi, Jō and Tantō programs.
- A lightweight glossary for the vocabulary that secretly holds the whole art together.
- A feedback/contribution flow that creates structured GitHub issues and JSON diffs from a friendly form — no accounts, no markdown knowledge required.
- Bookmarks, dark mode, gentle motion — designed to feel quiet, not shouty.

### Why I Built It

I wanted a reference I could actually use between classes: quick wording checks, the correct attack name, a reminder of uke’s role, or the common mistakes I always repeat. I also want to keep Aikidō knowledge portable — not trapped in a video description or a closed platform. Text first, links second, then media when it genuinely clarifies.

### What’s in v0.9

- Library with cards for techniques, versions, and level hints
- Keyboard‑first search (↑/↓ to navigate, Enter to open) with smart result layout
- Technique layout: steps, uke guidance, common mistakes, context, and media embeds (YouTube no‑cookie)
- Guide pages
- Exam program (5th Kyū → 1st Dan)
- Dan Overview (2nd–5th) in human words, not legalese
- Advanced tables: Saya‑no‑Uchi, Jō basics, Tantō responses
- Glossary with category filters
- Feedback & Contributions (Beta)
  - Improve an existing technique
  - Add a new variation/version
  - Propose a new technique (bilingual form, taxonomy builder, slug preview, duplicate detector)
  - App feedback & bug reports
  - Download JSON report (for the contributor)
- GitHub Bridge: serverless POST → labeled issue with structured Markdown + the exact JSON diff I need to merge


### Product Choices I’m Happy With

- Text is the feature. Videos are linked (with timestamps later), but the core is clean writing, not pausing frames.
- Bilingual from day one. English + German in the UI and content, with optional Japanese names/kanji where it helps recognition.
- Base vs. Version. Each technique has a base form; variations live beside it (teacher/dojo differences), which keeps search sane and avoids forked pages.
- “Contributor first” forms. Steps are discrete items, uke guidance is structured, taxonomy is picked — not typed — which makes the generated JSON consistent and easy to review.
- No uploads for third‑party media. Links only. Simpler legally, lighter technically.

### Under the Hood

- Front‑end: React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind for styling, Lucide icons, framer‑motion used sparingly.
- Data model: plain JSON files per technique. Each holds localized names/summaries, taxonomy (attack, weapon, entry, hanmi, level), versions, steps, uke notes, common mistakes, and context.
- Search: client‑side, optimized lists, keyboard navigation, immediate feedback.
- Contributions: a single `/api/feedback` Vercel Function validates a payload with Zod, assigns a request ID, and creates a labeled GitHub Issue:
  - Labels like `cat:technique`, `ent:variation`, `loc:en`, etc.
  - A readable Markdown summary plus a machine‑friendly `diffJson` block (with explicit "EMPTY" where the reviewer should fill in).
  - Secrets are only on the server: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`.
- Safety: basic origin allow‑list, a honeypot, and a very short TTL window to discourage automated spam without punishing humans.
- Design: densified spacing that still breathes, subtle elevation on hover (no glow disco), and micro‑delays tuned to “feels fast.”

### Little UX Details That Make Me Smile

- Result chips (“Irimi”, “3rd Kyū”, “Glossary”) align to titles so your eyes scan in one pass.
- Uke section reads like an instruction your partner could actually follow.
- Common mistakes are up‑right, not scolding — exactly the kind of note your teacher whispers after class.
- Loading is a tiny monoline loop — not because spinners are cool, but because it disappears before you notice it.

### What I Learned (Again)

- The fastest way to get real feedback is to invite it — so I built the bridge to GitHub early.
- Good names and a stable JSON schema are worth more than clever code.
- When you write both languages yourself, you design better because you feel where the copy strains.
- “Ship the calm part first.” Fancy pages (maps, studio directories) can wait; the library and guide had to feel solid.

### Roadmap

- Content: round out the base set; add clean references + timestamps.
- Mobile polish: offline cache for visited techniques.
- Printable views: one‑page exam cards.
- Contributor accounts (optional): sign your work; keep anonymous as a default.
- Instructor tools: dojo/lineage notes and private drafts.
- Club map (DE): probably v2 — useful, but only when the core library is rich.

If you practice Aikidō — or you just enjoy calm interfaces — try Enso for a minute. Search a technique you know, skim the uke notes, and tell me what’s missing. I’m building this the way I train: small corrections, every week, until it feels natural.

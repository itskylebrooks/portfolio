### Enso — a calm place to learn (and keep) Aikidō

I’m a visual learner. If I can *see* it, I can remember it. In the last months I started studying Aikidō theory at home and noticed the pattern: lots of small, scattered pieces, very few structured, searchable resources—especially on a phone before class. Many sites feel cluttered or dated; even large official portals get heavy, with multiple nav bars and information tucked into far-apart pages. Useful, yes—but hard to *navigate*.

Enso is my answer: a minimal, fast knowledge base for techniques, programs, and terms—built to read clearly and to *feel* calm. It’s also a path for the community to contribute without wrestling with a CMS or Markdown.

### How it started (and kept growing)

My first idea was simple: collect the techniques I need for exams—something better than a long Apple Notes doc. Then I fell down the rabbit hole: card rhythm, search behavior, taxonomy, bilingual copy, tiny motions that make the UI breathe. I’ve never taken a design or web-dev course; I just care about look + flow and I’ve spent years creating things (drawing, music, writing). This project became the place where craft and code met. I polished every detail that touched the experience—sometimes a blessing, sometimes a trap—and learned fast by shipping.

Enso grew with me. I re-thought how to model variants, how to keep performance snappy on low-end devices, how to make the heavy parts of Aikidō feel light on screen. Now my older projects look rough by comparison—and that’s the point. Progress.

### What Enso is (in one breath)

Not an encyclopedia of dry text. Not a toy demo to “prove websites can be pretty.”  
It’s a **practical study companion**: a searchable, bilingual library with structure, not noise—filters, fast search, and bookmarks you’ll actually use.

### What it does today

- **Search-first library.** Short, clear summaries; badges for entry/hanmi/level; keyboard navigation.
- **Technique layout.** Sections that map to how people learn: **Steps**, **Uke**, **Common Mistakes**, **Context**, **Media**.
- **Variants without chaos.** Each technique has a **Base** form; **Versions** sit beside it (different entries, hanmi, dojo/trainer differences) so nothing forks into separate pages.
- **Exam guides.** A Guide for the DAB path (5th Kyū → 1st Dan), **Dan Overview (2nd–5th)** in human words, plus an **Advanced** page (Saya-no-Uchi, Jō basics, Tantō responses).
- **Glossary.** Clean terms with filters; helpful for newcomers and for sanity checks.
- **Contributions.** A friendly form that turns suggestions into labeled **GitHub Issues** with a structured **JSON diff** (places I need to fill are marked `"EMPTY"`). No accounts, no uploads—**links only** for media.
- **Local-first.** Bookmarks and preferences stay on your device. Export/Import is there if you switch devices.
- **Design that stays out of the way.** Subtle elevation on hover, clear spacing, and a micro “breathing dot” while loading that fades before you notice it.

### Decisions I’m proud of

- **Tight, useful sections.** *Steps* for clarity, *Uke* for safety and cooperation, *Common Mistakes* for real life, *Context* for when/why, and *Media* only when it actually helps.
- **A sane taxonomy.** Techniques carry **attack, weapon, entry, hanmi, level**, plus versions. This lets me represent dojo/trainer differences **without** arguing which one is “standard.”
- **Contributor-first forms.** Steps are typed step-by-step; uke notes, key points, and mistakes are structured; the taxonomy is picked—not typed. That consistency makes reviewing faster and keeps the JSON clean.
- **Animations with a purpose.** A gentle focus track glides behind search results; transitions feel liquid, not flashy. Motion supports orientation.
- **Navigation you don’t have to learn.** Clear panels, predictable routes, obvious back/forward state. Cards show tags and descriptions so you can scan at speed.
- **Powerful search.** It understands tags and descriptions and lets you **bookmark** straight from results. Fewer clicks, more flow.

### Under the hood

- **Stack.** React + TypeScript + Vite; Tailwind for styling; Lucide icons; framer-motion used sparingly. Deployed on Vercel.
- **Data.** Plain JSON per technique (EN/DE), with base + versions, taxonomy, steps, uke notes, mistakes, context, media.
- **GitHub bridge.** A small Vercel Function (`/api/feedback`) validates payloads (Zod), assigns a request ID, and opens labeled Issues with a readable summary **plus** a machine-friendly `diffJson`. Secrets live server-side.
- **Safety.** Origin allow-list, a honeypot, and tiny timing guards to discourage bot spam while keeping the form instant for humans.

### Why this exists

Between classes I want quick checks that *actually help*: the correct attack name, the angle for entry, what uke should feel, and the three mistakes I always repeat. I also want Aikidō knowledge to remain portable—**text first, links second**—so it isn’t trapped in a video timeline or a closed platform.

### What’s next

Enso will keep growing in the only direction that matters: **useful clarity**. More techniques and kata pages, better visualizations (e.g., footprints/body lines on glossary pages), and careful features that respect the “calm” of the app. As the system expands, the structure will tighten—so power never costs friendliness.

Harmony stays the goal. And Aikidō.

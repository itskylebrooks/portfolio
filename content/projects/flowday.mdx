## Flowday — my first “real” project

I’ve started and abandoned plenty of side projects. Flowday is the first one that stuck — the first thing I use every day and ship for other people to use too. Building it didn’t just give me an app; it flipped a switch. This is where I actually started learning web dev for real, shipping features, breaking things, fixing them, and caring about the product more than the code golf.

### What it is (in one breath)

Flowday is a 20-second mood ritual: pick up to three emojis, slide a color, optionally add a song. From that tiny input it generates visuals you can look back on — weekly “flowing” ribbons, a monthly color mix that feels like a weather map of your month, emoji constellations, and cassette-style “song of the day” cards.

It’s Telegram-first (Mini App) with optional cloud sync using your Telegram ID. Web build exists too, with export/import for people who don’t want accounts.

### Why I built it

Most mood apps are either essays or sliders from “bad → good.” Feelings don’t fit on a ruler. I wanted something quick, playful, and visual — closer to leaving a brushstroke than filling a form. Also, I’m lazy: if it takes longer than replying to a text, I won’t do it.

### What it does today

- Three emojis + a color — your “vibe” for the day in seconds
- Week Flow — 7 blended bands; a soft timeline you can actually feel
- Month Mix — a continuous ribbon showing which hues dominated
- Constellations — recurring emojis become “stars,” with subtle motion
- Song Echoes — cassette cards for days you add music
- Reminders — optional daily ping (Telegram, server-side cron)
- Sync — Telegram accounts only; anonymous local mode still works
- Export/Import — keep your data portable (especially on the web build)

### Decisions I’m happy with

- Local-first by default. Your entries live on your device unless you opt in.
- No email logins. I tried. It slowed me down and didn’t help the experience. Telegram sign-in keeps it simple.
- Ship the feeling. I prioritized the visuals and flow over chasing every edge case on day one.

### Behind the build

Flowday is where I stopped “studying web dev” and started using it. I leaned on AI as a pair-programmer, but the product decisions, iterations, and stubbornness were mine. I fought with sync, redesigned settings three times, and learned that good UX often means deleting code.

Stack: React + TypeScript + Vite, Tailwind, Vercel serverless (API + cron), Supabase (Postgres + RLS), Telegram Mini Apps SDK, Telegram Analytics (anonymous).

Notable bits:

- Telegram-only sync keyed by telegram_id (no email, no password).
- Serverless cron that fans out reminder batches (and won’t explode at small scale).
- Export format that’s human-readable JSON so future-me can migrate it anywhere.

### What I learned

- Shipping beats polishing. A working 1.0 with a few dents > a perfect repo nobody runs.
- Design is a feature. The visuals are the value here; people react to how it feels.
- Scope is a weapon. Saying “Telegram first” unlocked momentum. Web can wait.
- AI is a tool, not a crutch. It accelerates, but you still have to choose.

### What’s next

- Blends with friends. Lightweight social — see a friend’s flow, react with one emoji, invite from Telegram.
- Month Mix v2. Better color weighting and a calmer, richer ribbon.
- Reminder time picker. Let people choose their hour (not just “evening”).
- Localization. RU/DE/ES to start.
- Telegram sharing. Stories and one-tap share of today’s card.
- TON exploration. Collectible monthly posters and/or blockchain-backed proofs (hashes, not raw data) if it adds real value.

### Try it

- Telegram: open the Mini App via the Flowday bot (DM me if you need the link).
- Code: GitHub — [itskylebrooks/flowday](https://github.com/itskylebrooks/flowday).
- Web build: a lightweight version with export/import.

If you try Flowday, I’d love to hear what you notice after a week. Did your month feel like its colors? Did the constellations surprise you? Ping me on Telegram @itskylebrooks.

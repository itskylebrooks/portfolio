### Flowday — my first “real” project

I’ve started and abandoned plenty of side projects, but Flowday is the first one that truly stuck. It’s the first thing I use every day and have shared with others. Building it didn’t just give me an app; it flipped a switch in how I think about web development. This was the moment I stopped just learning and started shipping—breaking things, fixing them, and caring more about the product than the code itself.

### What it is (in one breath)

At its core, Flowday is a quick 20-second mood ritual. You pick up to three emojis, slide a color, and optionally add a song. From that simple input, the app generates visuals you can revisit later: weekly “flowing” ribbons that feel like a soft timeline, a monthly color mix resembling a weather map of your emotions, emoji constellations that subtly move, and cassette-style “song of the day” cards. It’s built primarily as a Telegram Mini App with optional cloud sync tied to your Telegram ID, but there’s also a web version with export/import features for those who prefer not to create accounts.

### Why I built it

Most mood tracking apps felt either like essays or sliders from “bad to good,” which never sat right with me. Feelings aren’t a straight line. I wanted something playful and visual—more like leaving a brushstroke than filling out a form. Plus, I’m lazy by nature; if it takes longer than replying to a text, I just won’t do it.

### What it does today

- Three emojis + a color — your “vibe” for the day in seconds
- Week Flow — 7 blended bands; a soft timeline you can actually feel
- Month Mix — a continuous ribbon showing which hues dominated
- Constellations — recurring emojis become “stars,” with subtle motion
- Song Echoes — cassette cards for days you add music
- Reminders — optional daily ping (Telegram, server-side cron)
- Sync — Telegram accounts only; anonymous local mode still works
- Export/Import — keep your data portable (especially on the web build)

### Decisions I’m happy with

I chose a local-first approach by default so your entries live on your device unless you opt in to sync. I tried email logins but found they slowed things down and didn’t improve the experience; sticking with Telegram sign-in keeps it simple and seamless. More than anything, I prioritized the feeling and flow of the visuals over chasing every edge case early on. Sometimes good UX means deleting code and letting the product breathe.

### Behind the build

Flowday marks the moment I stopped “studying web dev” and started truly using it. I leaned on AI as a pair programmer, but every product decision, iteration, and stubborn fix came from me. Syncing was a battle, settings got redesigned three times, and I learned that the best user experience often requires ruthless simplification. The stack is React with TypeScript and Vite, styled with Tailwind, deployed on Vercel serverless functions handling API and cron jobs, and backed by Supabase Postgres with Row-Level Security. The Telegram Mini Apps SDK and anonymous Telegram Analytics round out the setup. Key technical choices include Telegram-only sync keyed by telegram_id, a serverless cron that efficiently handles reminder batches without breaking a sweat, and a human-readable JSON export format that future me can migrate anywhere.

### What I learned

Shipping beats polishing every time. A working 1.0 with some rough edges is better than a perfect repo nobody uses. Design isn’t just decoration; it’s a core feature—people respond to how the app feels more than its raw functionality. Choosing to focus on Telegram first unlocked momentum and kept the scope manageable. AI helped speed things up, but it’s a tool, not a crutch—you still have to make the hard choices.

### What’s next

- Blends with friends. Lightweight social — see a friend’s flow, react with one emoji, invite from Telegram.
- Month Mix v2. Better color weighting and a calmer, richer ribbon.
- Reminder time picker. Let people choose their hour (not just “evening”).
- Localization. RU/DE/ES to start.
- Telegram sharing. Stories and one-tap share of today’s card.
- TON exploration. Collectible monthly posters and/or blockchain-backed proofs (hashes, not raw data) if it adds real value.


If you give Flowday a try, I’d love to hear what you notice after a week. Did your month feel like its colors? Did the constellations surprise you? Ping me on Telegram @itskylebrooks.

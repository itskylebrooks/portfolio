### Flowday — my first “real” project

For a long time, my learning cycles looked the same: dive into syntax, grind through exercises, hit burnout, and then start over. It felt like spinning my wheels—never quite building anything real. I wanted to break that pattern. Instead of waiting to be “ready,” I decided to just start prototyping, making something tangible that I could use and share. Flowday is that project. It’s the first thing I’ve stuck with, the first app I open every day, and the first I’ve shared with others. More than just code, it flipped a switch in how I approach building—shipping imperfect work, learning fast, and caring more about the experience than the lines of code.

### What it is (in one breath)

Flowday is a quick 20-second mood ritual. You pick up to three emojis, slide a color, and optionally add a song. From that simple input, the app creates visuals you can revisit later: weekly “flowing” ribbons that feel like a soft timeline, a monthly color mix resembling a weather map of your emotions, emoji constellations that subtly move, and cassette-style “song of the day” cards. It has both a web version and a Telegram-optimized Mini App with optional cloud sync tied to your Telegram ID, but you can also keep your data local if you prefer.

### Why I built it

Most mood tracking apps felt either like essays or sliders from “bad to good,” which never sat right with me. Feelings aren’t a straight line. I wanted something playful and visual—more like leaving a brushstroke than filling out a form. Plus, I’m lazy by nature; if it takes longer than replying to a text, I just won’t do it.

### What it does today

- Three emojis + a color — your “vibe” for the day in seconds  
- Week Flow — 7 blended bands; a soft timeline you can actually feel  
- Month Mix — a continuous ribbon showing which hues dominated  
- Constellations — recurring emojis become “stars,” with subtle motion  
- Song Echoes — cassette cards for days you add music  
- Reminders — optional daily ping (Telegram, server-side cron)  
- Sync — Telegram accounts only; anonymous local mode still works  
- Export/Import — keep your data portable (especially on the web build)  

### Reflections on the journey

Building Flowday taught me that shipping beats polishing every time. I learned to embrace rough edges and focus on the feeling the app creates rather than chasing every edge case or perfect line of code. Choosing a local-first approach with optional Telegram sync kept things simple and respectful of privacy. The tech stack—React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vercel, Supabase, and Telegram Mini Apps—gave me the tools to iterate quickly. AI helped speed up some parts, but the hard decisions and product soul came from me. Simplifying relentlessly turned out to be the best user experience.

### What’s next?

The next step for Flowday is evolution, not expansion. I want to redesign the desktop experience — right now it’s still mostly a stretched mobile layout — and make the entire interface smoother, faster, and more adaptive across devices. Performance and stability come first; Flowday should feel light and reliable no matter where it runs. From there, I’ll start exploring new features and visualizations that deepen the sense of reflection and beauty behind each day’s entry, keeping the app simple in intent but richer in expression.

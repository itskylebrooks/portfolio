### A dark-only portfolio focused on content and clarity

I wanted a site that loads fast, reads clearly, and doesn’t get in the way. This portfolio is a single-page React app with a calm header and three main sections: Projects, Blog, and Experience. Content is written in MDX, with typed metadata living alongside each entry, making writing and managing posts straightforward and enjoyable without a CMS. Projects and blog posts are listed by reading metadata from MDX files, and each page uses a shared Prose renderer for consistent, accent-aware dark mode typography. Smooth scrolling, subtle motion, and strong keyboard/focus states make the site accessible and pleasant to use.

### Build highlights

The MDX-first content approach keeps metadata and writing together, eliminates duplication, and makes editing enjoyable. Accent-aware typography is handled with `prose-headings:` classes for clean, maintainable color. Accessibility is prioritized with clear focus rings, readable contrast, and underlined links. The stack is modern but lean: Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, React Router, and MDX via `@mdx-js/rollup`, with content loaders for slugs and sorting. Small, reusable components keep the UI tidy and maintainable.

### Decisions I'm happy with

Keeping everything on a single page turned out to be the best choice — it keeps the experience grounded and fast, like a personal workspace instead of a product site. The minimalist layout lets the content breathe, and small Motion transitions give just enough life without demanding attention. I like how the color system works too: each project subtly carries its own hue through cards, buttons, and headings, hinting at personality within uniformity. Even the header — just my name and four icons — feels right: simple, confident, and quiet in the best way.

## A simple, dark-only portfolio I actually like using

I wanted a site that loads fast, reads clearly, and doesn’t get in the way. This is a dark-only, typography-first layout with small, deliberate motion and strong keyboard/focus states.

### What it is

- A single-page app with a calm header and three sections on home: Projects, Blog, Contact.  
- Project and blog entries live as MDX files with typed `meta` and are rendered lazily per page.  
- Accent-aware project pages — headings tint to the project color for subtle personality.

### Why I built it this way

I prefer content-forward sites that don’t fight me when writing. Moving projects/blog to MDX lets me write long-form entries with structure (headings, lists, code) and keep metadata close to content without another CMS.

### What it does today

- Home lists projects and posts by reading metadata from MDX.  
- Project page renders header (date, title, summary, tech chips, links) + the project MDX body via a shared Prose renderer.  
- Blog page does the same for posts (MDX), with a clean list view and detail view.  
- Sticky header supports “About” scroll and respects `prefers-reduced-motion` when animating scroll.

### Decisions I’m happy with

- MDX-first content. No duplicated JSON; metadata lives beside the writing.  
- `import.meta.glob` collectors: eager for meta indexing, lazy for per-page content — simple and fast.  
- Accent-aware typography: `prose-headings:` classes apply the project color without custom CSS.  
- A11y defaults: clear focus-visible rings, underlined links, readable contrast.

### Behind the build

- Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + React Router.  
- MDX via `@mdx-js/rollup` with a tiny `*.mdx` typing that exposes `export const meta`.  
- Content loaders in `src/content/*` that derive slugs from filenames and sort by date.  
- Small components: `Section`, `ProjectCard`, `BlogRow`, `IconLink`, and a `Prose` wrapper with `prose-invert`.

Notable bits:

- Accent-aware project pages: headings adopt the project’s accent color.  
- Smooth anchor scroll that degrades to instant when users prefer reduced motion.  
- Clean, clickable cards with tiny hover shifts and no gimmicks.

### What I learned

- Keep content in files you like editing; you’ll write more.  
- MDX + eager meta + lazy content is a sweet spot for small sites.  
- Small, named components make it easy to keep the UI tidy without a design system.

### What’s next

- RSS for blog posts.  
- OG tags and per-entry SEO helpers.  
- Light image handling for post/project screenshots.  
- Simple archive pages by year.

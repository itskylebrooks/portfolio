### Haven — a calm network for real connection

We built too many ways to talk and too few to *feel heard*.  
Haven is my attempt to design a social space that feels like a conversation at twilight — small, sincere, finite. No feeds that scroll forever, no ads asking for attention, no metrics that turn care into competition. Just expression, reciprocity, and peace of mind.

### Why Haven exists

Loneliness didn’t vanish with technology; it multiplied. The web connected everyone but taught us to shout instead of listen. Haven is built for people who still want to share — but quietly. It’s a space where words and images return to their human pace: thoughtful, limited, alive.

### The core idea

A paid, invite-only network combining the best of early Twitter’s clarity and early Instagram’s warmth.  
No public algorithms, no performance pressure. Everything is chronological, private by default, and finite by design. You read, you resonate, you reflect — and you’re done.

### The experience

- **Circles.** Your private world — mutual connections only. Posts here are personal, ephemeral if you choose (24h, 7d, or permanent). Feedback is private: *Resonate* replaces “Like”; *Reflect* replaces “Comment.” No numbers, no counters, just quiet acknowledgment.  
- **Signals.** Public, deliberate broadcasts — one a day at most. Ideal for journaling thoughts or sharing work without chasing reach.  
- **Profiles.** Simple, human pages with Flow (text) and Grid (visual) modes. No follower counts or activity graphs.  
- **Search.** Calm memory. You find what matters — not what’s trending.  
- **Feed ends.** When you’re caught up, you’re done. Haven gives your attention back.

### Why I’m proud of this

It’s not trying to fix social media — it’s trying to remember what *social* feels like.  
I wanted to design something that helps people share without fear of being watched, compared, or optimized.  
Haven is for artists, writers, developers, thinkers — anyone tired of noise but still wanting to be seen.
